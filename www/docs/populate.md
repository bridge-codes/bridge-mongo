# Populate Function

The populate() function is not yet implemented in bridge-mongo, but it will be available soon. This function is used to retrieve documents that reference other documents and replace the references with the referenced documents. If you are interested in this feature, please come to our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/yxjrwm7Bfr) and let us know.

In the meantime, we recommend trying the [aggregate()](aggregate) function, which is already implemented and functioning well. This function can be used to perform complex queries and transformations on your data, including joins between collections.
