# Introduction

Welcome to the bridge-mongo documentation!

## About bridge-mongo

`Bridge-mongo` is a **typed framework** built on top of `Mongoose`, the popular MongoDB object-document mapping (ODM) library. It provides a type-safe approach to querying MongoDB databases that makes it almost impossible to write poorly constructed queries, all while using the same syntax as Mongoose.

By leveraging **TypeScript**, bridge-mongo offers a comfortable development experience with powerful IDE guidance while writing queries. Additionally, the results of each query are **fully typed**, ensuring that developers can work confidently and without fear of runtime errors.

One of the standout features of bridge-mongo is its beautifully implemented aggregate function, which solves a common pain point for developers. In Mongoose, creating big complex pipelines for the **aggregate function** can be a struggle, but bridge-mongo resolves this issue by providing a more user-friendly approach to aggregating data.

Errors are also handled with type objects, which makes it **easier to handle errors** and ensure that code is always correct. With bridge-mongo, developers can focus on building applications instead of debugging poorly typed queries.

Overall, bridge-mongo is a powerful and user-friendly MongoDB ORM that offers the benefits of type safety and **fully typed query results**, using the same syntax as Mongoose, and with a beautifully implemented aggregate function, allowing developers to work faster and with greater confidence.
